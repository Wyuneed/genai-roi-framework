# Pre/Post Deployment Scorecard

> **Purpose:** Compare baseline (pre-deployment) performance against actual outcomes (post-deployment) to validate ROI projections and make the business case for continued investment or scaling.

> **Instructions:** Complete the "Pre-Deployment" column before launch. Complete the "Post-Deployment" columns at 3, 6, and 12 months after launch. Calculate variance against the original projection.
