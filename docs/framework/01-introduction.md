# Introduction: Why ROI Matters for GenAI

## The Business Reality

Generative AI is no longer a research curiosity — it's a board-level topic. Organizations worldwide are deploying LLMs, diffusion models, and AI agents across every function. Yet the most common question remains unanswered in most investment proposals:

> **"What do we actually get back?"**

This framework exists to answer that question with rigor, not hype.

## The ROI Problem with GenAI

Traditional software ROI is relatively straightforward: you reduce X hours of manual work, you save Y dollars per year. GenAI ROI is harder because:

1. **Benefits are diffuse.** A coding assistant helps 50 engineers slightly. A customer support bot deflects thousands of tickets. Neither benefit is captured in a single line item.

2. **Quality improvements are hard to price.** Fewer errors, better decisions, faster onboarding — these matter but aren't on any invoice.

3. **Costs are non-obvious.** API token costs, prompt engineering time, model drift, and hallucination remediation are invisible until you're in production.

4. **Adoption curves kill projections.** Day-1 usage rarely matches Month-6 usage. Most ROI models are linear when reality is an S-curve.

5. **Opportunity costs are real.** Choosing GenAI means not choosing something else. That trade-off must be surfaced.

## What This Framework Provides

This framework gives you a **structured, honest, and repeatable** way to evaluate GenAI ROI. It is:

- **Universal** — works for any GenAI use case, industry, or org size
- **Modular** — use the whole framework or just the parts you need
- **Transparent** — every assumption is explicit and challengeable
- **Practical** — built from real-world implementations, not theory

## How to Use This Framework

### For a Quick Estimate
1. Open the [Interactive ROI Calculator](../../calculator/index.html)
2. Select a pre-built use case template
3. Adjust the numbers to match your context
4. Get an instant ROI projection with break-even timeline

### For a Full Business Case
1. Read [02 — ROI Model](02-roi-model.md) to understand the 4-pillar model
2. Work through [03 — Cost Model](03-cost-model.md) to estimate all costs
3. Work through [04 — Benefit Model](04-benefit-model.md) to quantify benefits
4. Run a [Break-Even Analysis](05-break-even-analysis.md) for stakeholders
5. Use the [Decision Guide](06-decision-guide.md) to stress-test your case
6. Package everything using the [Business Case Template](../templates/business-case-template.md)

### For a Specific Use Case
Jump directly to the [Use Case Library](../use-cases/) and find your scenario. Each playbook walks through the complete ROI analysis for that specific application.

## Core Principles

**Principle 1: Conservative assumptions win trust.**
It is better to under-promise and over-deliver. Build your base case on the low end and show upside scenarios separately.

**Principle 2: Measure baselines before you deploy.**
ROI is a comparison. If you don't know your "before" state, you can't prove your "after" state. Instrument your baseline metrics before going live.

**Principle 3: Total cost of ownership, not just API bills.**
The model API is often the smallest cost. Engineering time, data preparation, evaluation, monitoring, and change management dwarf token costs at scale.

**Principle 4: Benefits have time value.**
A dollar saved in Month 1 is worth more than a dollar saved in Month 12. Use discounted cash flow for multi-year projections in capital-intensive deployments.

**Principle 5: Risk-adjust everything.**
Not every project succeeds. Build a pessimistic scenario where adoption is slow and costs run over. If that scenario still pencils out, you have a strong investment.

## Who This Is For

| Role | How to Use This Framework |
|------|--------------------------|
| C-Suite / Board | Focus on [ROI Model](02-roi-model.md), [Decision Guide](06-decision-guide.md), and the [Business Case Template](../templates/business-case-template.md) |
| Product Managers | Use the full framework to build investment proposals and track post-launch performance |
| Engineering Leads | Focus on [Cost Model](03-cost-model.md) for accurate technical cost estimation |
| Finance / Analysts | Use [Break-Even Analysis](05-break-even-analysis.md) and the calculator's scenario modeling |
| Startup Founders | Start with a use case playbook, then use the calculator to model unit economics |
