## Cost Drivers

| Cost Item | Typical Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tool licensing | $20–$500/user/month | Jasper, Copy.ai, custom API implementations |
| Custom build (API) | $30K–$150K | If building custom workflow vs. buying tool |
| Prompt engineering | $5K–$25K | Brand voice, style guides, output templates |
| Workflow integration | $10K–$40K | CMS, DAM, approval workflow integration |

| Quality review process | Ongoing | Editor time for AI-generated content review |

---

## Benefit Drivers

### 1. Labor Cost Reduction (Internal Team)
Internal writers spend less time per piece, freeing capacity for higher-value creative work.

```
Internal Saving = (Old Time per Piece - New Time per Piece) × Pieces per Month
               × 12 × Fully-Loaded Writer Hourly Rate × Productivity Capture Rate
```

### 2. Agency / Freelancer Cost Reduction
Many organizations replace or significantly reduce external content spend.

```
Agency Saving = (Current External Spend) × (Reduction Rate)
```

Typical reduction: 30–60% of agency/freelancer spend replaced by AI-assisted internal production.

### 3. Content Volume Increase (Revenue Driver)
More content = more organic traffic, more conversions, more pipeline.

```
Revenue Value = (Additional Content Pieces per Month) × (Average Organic Visits per Piece)
              × (Conversion Rate) × (Average Revenue per Conversion)
```

### 4. Personalization Uplift
Personalized content consistently outperforms generic content on conversion metrics.

### 5. Speed to Market
Faster content production means faster campaign execution and competitive advantage.

## Worked Example

### Organization Profile
- B2B SaaS company, 8-person marketing team
- 60 blog posts/month, 200 social posts/month, 40 email campaigns/month
- External agency spend: $15,000/month (blog + social)
- Internal writer (2 FTE): $90,000 fully-loaded each ($48/hr)
- Average time: 4 hrs/blog post, 20 min/social post, 3 hrs/email

### Investment
- Jasper Teams + custom prompts: $1,200/month ($14,400/year)
- Setup and training: $8,000 one-time
- Prompt engineering: $12,000 one-time

**Total Year 1 Cost:** $34,400

### Expected Outcomes
- Time per blog post: 4 hrs → 1.5 hrs (63% reduction)
- Time per social post: 20 min → 8 min (60% reduction)
- Time per email: 3 hrs → 1.2 hrs (60% reduction)
- Agency replacement: 40% of current spend
- Content volume increase: 50% more blog posts (90/month)
- Productivity capture rate: 65%

### ROI Calculation

**Internal Labor Saving:**
```
Blog: 60 posts/month × 2.5 hrs saved × $48/hr × 12 × 65% = $56,160/year
Social: 200 posts/month × 0.2 hrs saved × $48/hr × 12 × 65% = $14,976/year
Email: 40 campaigns/month × 1.8 hrs saved × $48/hr × 12 × 65% = $26,957/year
```

**Agency Cost Reduction:**
```
$15,000/month × 40% × 12 = $72,000/year
```

**Total Annual Benefit:** $170,093
**Year 1 Total Cost:** $34,400
**Year 1 ROI:** 395%

**Break-even: Month 3**

> Revenue upside from additional 30 blog posts/month not included — this could add significant SEO and pipeline value depending on your content conversion metrics.

## Tips for Measurement

1. **Tag all AI-assisted content** in your CMS from day one. You need to compare performance of AI-assisted vs. human-only content over time.

2. **Measure time with a simple tracking sheet** — before and after AI deployment, have writers log their time per piece for 30 days each.

3. **Don't conflate quality with freshness.** Content published with AI may perform better just because there's more of it, not because it's better quality. Run controlled experiments.

4. **Track revision cycles.** If AI-generated drafts require 3× more editor revisions, the time saving disappears. Measure net time including editing.

5. **Set content quality benchmarks** (readability score, brand voice score, SEO score) and track them pre/post AI adoption.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Impact | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Publishing without human review | Brand risk, factual errors | Establish mandatory editorial review step |
| Generic AI voice | Content indistinguishable from competitors | Build detailed brand voice prompts and examples |
| Ignoring SEO in prompts | Low-performing content | Include target keywords and SEO intent in prompts |
| No attribution or disclosure policy | Regulatory/reputational risk | Define AI content disclosure policy upfront |
| Killing writer creativity | Team disengagement, talent loss | Position AI as assistant, not replacement |
